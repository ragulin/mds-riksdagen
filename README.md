MDS of the swedish parliement.
=============================

Inspired by chapter 9 of the book [Machine Learning for Hackers](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920018483.do) and the python port available [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/carljv/Will_it_Python/master/MLFH/ch9/ch9.ipynb) I made this visualization based on the voting data from the swedish parliement.
